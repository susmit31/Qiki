# Qiki - Wikipedia for People in a Hurry
I was having to read a lot of Wikipedia articles for a job exam, and so coded this up in an afternoon to ease my work a bit. Provides *extractive summaries* (i.e., takes the most important sentences out of the article verbatim). On the plus side, this gives you direct quotes from the article. On the negative side, sometimes the context isn't quite clear for an extracted sentence. Maybe someday I'll move to abstractive summaries, but not for now, as my purposes are served decently by this prototype.
